       "  'text': 'It\\'s been a bruising first week back for the government, full of resignations, reshuffles, and ructions in markets. All of this will have an impact on what ends up in the chancellor\\'s famous red box outside No 11 in 11 weeks\\' time. The first thing to note is that it will be Rachel Reeves holding that briefcase for the second time on 26 November. Whatever occurred withthe deputy prime minister, the security of Reeves\\' position was apparent in her conversation with me in Birmingham to announce the date of the Budget. In Downing Street, the message received fromthe market reaction to the chancellor\\'s summer tearsin the Commons was that the cost of borrowing went up when it was thought she was leaving office. When I saw her, brandishing a hard hat and trowel at a housebuilding site, there seemed no question of her going anywhere. \"We need you to get qualified and get more flats and houses up,\" she told two bricklaying apprentices, while not entirely convincing with her own trowel technique. She rather robustlydismissed speculationabout Budget measures, large black hole forecasts, and had some sharpish wordseven for the Office for Budget Responsibility, which we will come back to. The chancellor spent the summer travelling the country \"listening to business\" and taking some time off on the Cornish coast. During that same period global bond markets have been looking fragile. Some economists have even floated the idea there is a £50bn black hole that could lead to the need for loans from the IMF. As politicians returned to work this week, and US traders returned on Tuesday from a national holiday, the 30-year gilt rate - the effective interest rate facing the UK government for very long-term borrowing - washeading for highsnot seen since the early days of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. There was some significance to the unwanted landmark: the gains from nearly three decades of relative macroeconomic stability since the Bank of England became independent were being unwound. I put to the chancellor that fragile bond markets were a reflection of the government\\'s, and her own, personal credibility issue. I have had similar interactions with previous chancellors, including Kwasi Kwarteng. Reeves was adamant that this was not the case, that the move in bond markets since the beginning of the year had been in line with global trends. \"Serious economists\" were not talking about the IMF or a UK-specific challenge, she said. By the end of the week, her bullishness was being proven accurate. The 30-year yield had fallen back, not just to where it was on Monday, but significantly lower, mainly off the back ofweaker-than-expected US jobs data. This was in common with many major economies. In other words, this week\\'s bond markets rollercoaster was not a verdict on UK domestic, economic or political developments. Indeed, by Wednesday the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey was playing down the entire focus on this measure, saying, \"It is quite a high number but it is not what is being used for funding at all at the moment actually.\" He was referring to the fact that such long-term borrowing only makes up a small fraction of overall government debt. And in terms of demand, there was no sign of a lack of appetite in actual sales of UK debt last week, with record demand on some measures. The bigger picture though is that these forms of debt do not directly affect, for example, five-year fixed mortgage rates. So the gilt markets are not fundamentally showing a mini-budget style UK-specific problem. At the same time, there is a clear warning signal here. Fragile global bond markets do keep an eye on any unattractive economic or political factors.In this case the UK\\'shigh inflation, and any doubt afterthe summer U-turnsabout the government\\'s control over events, could quickly turn problematic. Indeed, expect the chancellor\\'s team to use the bond market rollercoaster to make the case that the answer to the autumn\\'s tricky Budget balancing act is not more debt through watering down her borrowing limits. Any gap, they will argue, will have to be filled by higher taxes or lower spending. The amount of that adjustment depends on markets and the judgement of the OBR on the long-term performance of the economy. There was some substance to the chancellor\\'s off-the-cuff comments to me suggesting the forecasters stick to their primary role rather than giving a \"running commentary on policy\". The OBR judgement on UK productivity could be the single biggest determinant of how much of a gap there is, and therefore how much Budget pain the chancellor needs to administer. Expect some haggling, with the Downing Street team of economists adamant that the OBR\\'s forecast should reflect their reforms, especially on planning. The first take of that critical independent judgement is expected to be delivered to the chancellor in the final days of this month, around the time of her conference speech in Liverpool. At that point the long list of potential Budget revenue raisers will start to populate the Treasury spreadsheet known as the \"scorecard\". Rumours will fly around. Indeed ministers are amazed at some of the speculation so far. For example,bank shares fellon suggestions the chancellor would enact a think tank report on windfall taxes, published when she was on holiday, that she has never even read. Departmental budgets have already been set in theSpending Review, and there is no plan to reopen that process, which must mean that any restraint will have to come from the wider Welfare Bill. The chancellor did not rule that out to me, but said there was \"more to do\" on reforms that helped people back into work.The new cabinet, without the former deputy PM, author of a leaked letter on wealth taxes, might be more amenable. All in all this is the chancellor\\'s chance to author some long-term, pro-growth reforms to the tax system. She still hopes to do that. But OBR spreadsheets, market ructions, and backbench unhappiness on cuts will ultimately determine just how big the extra tax demand in the red box is on 26 November. Much can change between now and then.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Food price inflation rose for the fifth month in a row in August with costs rising at the fastest pace since the beginning of last year, official figures show. The cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks grew at an annual rate of 5.1% as beef, butter, milk and chocolate prices continued to surge. However, despite the increase in food costs, price growth in other areas such as air fares slowed, leaving the overall rate of UK inflation at 3.8% - the same as July. Economists said food bills have been rising because supermarkets were passing on government increases in the minimum wage and National Insurance Contributions (NIC) to shoppers through higher prices. Overall inflation remains above the Bank of England\\'s 2% target and expectations are growing that its rate-setting committee will hold interest rates on Thursday. Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who will set out the government\\'s tax and spending plans in the Budget on 26 November, said that she knew \"families are finding it tough and that for many the economy feels stuck\". She added: \"That\\'s why I\\'m determined to bring costs down and support people who are facing higher bills.\" In her first Budget last year, Reeves announcedan increase in National Insurance Contributions for employersas well asa rise in the minimum wage. The decision led to a backlash from many businesses, who argued it would lead to higher prices for customers. Reeves previously told firms after she would not be \"coming back with more borrowing or more taxes\",but speculation is growing over what taxes the chancellor will hike. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said price growth was \"deeply worrying for families\" and said Labour\\'s tax policies are \"stoking inflation\". The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which publishes the figures, said the 5.1% increase in food and drink prices is the highest rate for 19 months. It also said that inflation in the UK was \"significantly higher\" than the estimates for large European economies such as France and Germany. In August, France\\'s inflation was 0.8% while Germany recorded price growth of 2.1%. Yael\\u202fSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said Britain had become \"an outlier in recent months on inflation compared to other major economies\". She said: \"Since April, the rise in inflation has been driven largely by domestic policy choices, including the increase in employers\\' National Insurance Contributions. \"These higher costs have been passed on by businesses to consumers, feeding through into higher headline inflation.\" Some food items have continued to see particularly big increases. In the year to August, beef and veal prices were up nearly 25%, while butter prices grew by nearly 19% and chocolate rose by 15.4%. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that food costs were outstripping average wage growth, which the ONS said reached 4.7% between May and July. \"With food inflation now outpacing wages, many families will be struggling with the rising cost of living,\" Kris Hamer, director of insight at the BRC, said. However, the prices of some goods such as clothing and footwear eased, which the BRC said was \"driven in part by retailers discounting the last of their summer collections\". It added: \"Key staples such as cereals and pasta fell in price on the month.\" James Smith, developed market economist at investment bank ING, said the inflation figure was \"certainly not good news for the Bank of England\". He told the BBC that it remaining at 3.8% \"means the prospect for further interest rate cuts this year very much hang in the balance\". \"In terms of where we go from here, food inflation could climb a little bit higher into the end of the year,\" he added. The Bank of England has cut interest rates five times since August last year, taking borrowing costs to 4%. It has said itexpects inflation to peak at 4% in September. The central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates on Thursday. It then has two further rate-setting meetings this year - in November and December. Even with a projected rise in inflation, Capital Economics said it doubts the Bank will cut rates in November. But Paul Dales, its chief UK economist, said: \"We still expect the looser labour market to weaken wage growth and eventually bring down UK inflation to similar rates as in the US and the eurozone, which will allow the Bank of England to cut rates from 4% now to 3% by the end of next year.\" Butter and chocolate prices have directly affected Tom Egan, who co-founded and runs Coosh Bakery in Mapperley, Nottingham with his wife Rachel. He said adverse weather conditions in cocoa-growing countries such as Ghana had \"more than doubled the price we get from our suppliers\". \"I think previously we were paying somewhere in the region of £60 for 10kg,\" he said. \"I think it has now gone up to over £150 for that same 10kg.\" Butter prices have risen by 50% over the year, with suppliers telling Mr Egan that \"the actual quantity of milk that is being imported into the UK has gone down so obviously supply and demand has meant the price has surged on things like butter\". Meanwhile, he said the rise in National Insurance Contributions had \"stung a little bit\", leading to the bakery being more cautious about investment in areas such as equipment and technology, which could improve productivity.

       "  'text': \"Matthew Prince maynot be a household name, but the world most certainly knows his work. Prince is the cofounder and CEO ofCloudflare. Launched in 2010, the internet infrastructure company has found itself increasingly in the position of serving as the web’s bodyguard. It filters out bad traffic, keeps sites safe, and stops them from crashing when too many people visit. Its tools defend against DDoS attacks. In 2017, Cloudflare made headlines when itdropped white supremacist site The Daily Stormer. (Maybe Prince’s name isringing a bellnow?) Cloudflare’s severing of ties with The Daily Stormer marked a momentous shift, one that came after years of claiming a neutral stance. Prince continues to evolve the way Cloudflare works. In July, the companyrolled out a new tooltasked with blocking unauthorized AI scraping. It effectively creates a pay-per-crawl model requiring AI platforms to shell out money if they want access to a site’s content. On this episode ofThe Big Interview, I talked to Prince about publishing, the old internet, and how his ideal version of the future web means that OpenAI just might become the Netflix of content. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Good to have you here, Matthew. MATTHEW PRINCE:Thanks for having me. You should have been warned ahead of time, but you probably weren't. We always start these conversations with some rapid-fire questions. Think of it like a warmup. Sort of like wind sprints or something. Exactly. First, what's the most embarrassing thing that regularly shows up in your feeds? Probably just all the political content. On X it’s pretty embarrassing. What can you teach me to do in two minutes or less? You don't actually have to teach me anything, but you need to commit that you could do it if you had to. I am pretty good at simple card tricks, so I could teach you a card trick to impress your friends. Oh, I like that. I like impressing people. Fiction or nonfiction? I tend to read more nonfiction, but I'm happier when I'm reading fiction. So I try to force myself to read fiction. The trashier the better. Alright, trashy fiction. What do your haters say about you? Oh God, people talk about neo-Nazis surprisingly a lot with me because we either kick or don't kick them off our platform. So I think [they say] I am responsible for all the bad things that appear somewhere on the internet. Inbox zero or inbox chaos? Zero. Same. OK, let’s jump into it. Are you ready? I am. Those were fun wind sprints. I enjoy that a lot more than, you know, high school PE. We do our best. Now, I love to ask people a little bit about where they came from, how they got to where they are. So I’m going to do that before we really get into what’s going on with Cloudflare right now. The original name of Cloudflare was the only thing worse than Cloudflare, because [those syllables] are really hard for English speakers to say. We were going to be Project Web Wall. Let's go back to where it started. Park City, Utah, where you grew up. You got your first computer. My understanding is you were 7. Were you always drawn to technology, even as a toddler, or was that sort of a lucky accident as far as gifts go? I got it from my grandmother, who was just with it. Apple had just released the Apple II. There wasn't a ton of access to technology in the way that kids have it today. So everyone else had an Atari. Everyone else had a VHS player. We had a Betamax player. But the computer was really the first time that I dove in and it was like a duck to water. I loved it. You majored in English, and you minored in computer science. Then you went to law school. What did you think you would end up doing? I thought I was gonna be the in-house counsel for some cool tech company. Oh, I like that. I was good at computers as a kid, and the University of Utah had this incredible computer science program, and they did these continuing education courses and my mom would sign up. And then I’d do all the homework, basically. So by the time I got to college, I thought I was gonna study computer science. I took computer science 101 and I was so bored that an arrogant 17-, 18-year-old me was like, “There's nothing I can learn from this.” So I switched my major to English literature. This is like ’92 to ’96. This was right as the internet was taking off. And I knew enough about it that I got hired to be one of the student network administrators on our campus and help build what was one of the first thousand websites. I felt like I was sort of there, but I was also kind of burned out from the whole thing. I wrote my college thesis on why the internet was a fad. No. Yeah. It was pretty embarrassing. I predicted that search engines were gonna become political, that there would be a conservative one and a liberal one. That hasn’t happened. That's interesting considering what’s happened with Cloudflare. When I got to the end, I was pretty good at standardized tests, so I took the LSAT. Didn't know how to really get a job, so I ended up applying to law school, and I went to law school and in ’96 being like, “Eh, this internet thing is a fad.” Somewhere in between I took a year off to basically goof around and be a ski instructor. By the time I actually got to the first day of class, I realized two things: One, the internet was gonna be kind of a big deal. And the second thing was that within about three days of law school I was like, “I'm not sure I'm cut out for this.” Oh. I finally found a type of law that I thought was really interesting, which was securities law, basically taking companies public. I spent the summer of ’99 working at a law firm in San Francisco. I worked on six IPOs in one summer. It was the dotcom boom. I was like, “This is really fun.” I bet. I thought, “I’ll go, I’ll do this for five years. I’ll find a company that’s really great, I’ll help them get ready for their IPO, they’ll hire me as their counsel.” I went back to school thinking that was what was going to happen in March of 2000. Then the bubble burst. The law firm called and said, “Hey, good news, bad news. The good news is you still have a job. Bad news is we don’t need any more securities lawyers, but bankruptcy is basically the same thing …” Oh no. I just didn't want to do that. So I was crying in my beer with a young law-professor guy named Doug Liman, and he's like, “Hey, my brother's starting a B2B”—what we call a SaaS company today, although we didn't at the time, in the insurance industry, which I knew nothing about—“would you be interested? They'll match your salary and give you this thing called stock.” I was like, “Yeah, that sounds better than being a bankruptcy attorney.” So I did that, and it was a disaster. That is a journey. There's been a lot written about Cloudflare's origins. But just so that people have a basic understanding, how would you describe the company's original mission, and how has that evolved? I was super lost. I was working as a bartender. And somewhat to run away from the sort of familial obligation of taking over my father's restaurant business, I applied to business school, and that's where I met my cofounder Michelle. What we saw back in 2009 was that all of the world of software was moving to the cloud. So inevitably that would mean that the security and networking tools, the firewalls of the world, would move to the cloud. So the original idea of Cloudflare was:How can you take a firewall and put it in the cloud? Makes sense. The problem that we had was we knew that in order to be a successful business, we'd eventually have to sell to really big banks and health care companies and governments and things like that. Right. In order to do that, we had to have something that was valuable in order to generate something that's valuable. We actually had to have data. So being plucky business students, we thought, “Well, what if we made a sort of stripped-down, light version of the service and gave it away for free?” That would allow us to gather a bunch of data that would be valuable for the firewall, for the big banks and things like that. At some level the whole story of Cloudflare is: If you take a firewall in the cloud and make it free, you create so many different problems. But in the process of solving all of those problems you build what Cloudflare is today, which is more than just a firewall in the cloud. Tell me how you describe the company today, and then I wanna jump into why you've been in the news so much recently. If I'm at a dinner party and you come up and ask me, “What do you do?” And I say, “I work for Cloudflare.” And they ask, “What does Cloudflare do?” I don't really want to talk to you much more. I say, “It makes the internet faster and protects it from bad guys,” and everyone's response to that is, “Oh, that's really nice.” And then they walk. They're like, “Oh, sounds great.” Yeah, “Thank you for doing that.” If I want to actually engage with someone, what I would say is, “When we wrote all the protocols for the internet in the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s, we had no idea what the internet was gonna become.” If you go back and read the original proposal for DNS or BGP or these fundamental kinds of technologies of the internet, like there's a section often on security, and it says, “This section is intentionally left blank.” Right? So no one has actually done the work to do that. And that's true in security. It's true in reliability, it's true in performance. And so now that we know how important this is, how do we go back and redesign all of those fundamental things about the internet? That's what motivates everyone at Cloudflare; that's what defines our roadmap. When we say we're trying to help build a better internet, that's literally what we try to do every single day. So let's talk about that better internet in the context of AI. A few months ago your companymade major news, especially with people working in media or the creator class, around what you are doing with AI bots and their ability to scrape websites with impunity. That’s how a lot of these AI models were trained in the first place, right? They scrape the internet, pull whatever content they want, and use it to train LLMs. Your company has now taken a major stand to stop that from happening without financial incentives for the creators of that content. Tell us a little bit about where that idea came from. So, my cofounder Michelle hates history lessons. I, on the other hand, am a recovering adjunct law professor. So … Oh boy. Let's just talk about the history of the internet, where we've been, where we are, where we're going, and what the opportunities and what the challenges are. So, the first thing is that there's this sort of mistaken belief that the web has been free. The web has never been free. Somebody has always paid for the web, because journalists like yourself and other folks at Condé Nast, other folks at, you know, all of the different media companies, they deserve to eat. Agreed. You know, if you go to a restaurant, they kind of want you to pay your bill. So somehow there has to be money that goes back to the people that are creating stuff, whether it's news or entertainment or anything else. For the last 25 years, the great patron of the internet has been Google. They created this incredible tool to let you search for things and then it gives you a treasure map and you can click on the links in that treasure map, and that will take you to content that Condé Nast or Meredith or whoever it is [created]. The key was that the traffic that their treasure maps generated then provided tools to turn that traffic into revenue, into dollars, that you could then pay creators with. Yes. Like, that’s an amazing thing. It has, at the same time, had some perverse effects [since] traffic has never been the best measure of quality in any kind of objective sense. You also had a bunch of publications like BuzzFeed that would literally A-B test headlines to figure out which ones generated the largest cortisol response, the largest stress response, because baiting you into clicking things—regardless of what the quality of the actual content was—was kind of the game. It became all about SEO. Again, I think Google has been a massive force for good in the world. The internet would not exist in the form that it is right now without Google's patronage. But that same sort of traffic-is-all-we-care-about [idea] is what led to Facebook, which was what led to TikTok. And we've kind of spiraled down this sort of attention-economy hole where I think all of us feel a little bit wistful for the internet of old, right? So that's kinda where we are today in terms of the content side. Right. What's been happening, though, is that the entire industry has moved away from search being the dominant interface of the web. You can actually see this at Google itself. Now, if you run a search it gives you back an answer at the top of the page. It doesn't give you a treasure map. Instead it provides you what they call an AI Overview, which has taken a whole bunch of content, smashed it together, summarized it in various ways, and synthesized it. And Google is just one piece. Like if you look at Perplexity, if you look at OpenAI, if you look at Anthropic, they're not search engines, they're answer engines. The difference is that if you just give someone the answer, then they don't generate traffic. They don't follow those links. We have the data on how much of that has changed. The short answer is that in Google's case it's about 10 times harder today, because of AI Overviews, to get traffic for the same amount of content than it was back when Google was just 10 blue links. And I would say [Google] has been very resistant to the notion that AI Overviews have damaged traffic to publishers. I think they've been very careful in saying that they're still sending a bunch of clicks to the web, but they've been very imprecise about what parts of the web are benefiting, what parts are hurting. So what we see is that if you're an ecommerce shop, AI Overviews haven't hurt you as much because, again, people still have to buy the thing. So they're like, “OK, which digital camera is the best digital camera to buy?” And they get an AI Overview that answers that, but they still then have to go buy the digital camera. So they still go to one of the digital camera sellers that's out there, but they're not readingWIRED's description of what digital camera is the bestdirectly. Right. I think they very much know that for things that are just purely information-based, the traffic to those things is just falling off of a cliff. But again, they couldn't generate that AI Overview if they hadn't slurped up the data from WIRED, and Ars Technica, and all the different companies out there that are actually doing the work to review the cameras. I’m still waiting for my check from Google. When is that coming? Google does send you a check, but they only send you a check—not personally, maybe—if a human has followed a link and then there's an ad thatDoubleClickserves. So Google is still supporting the ecosystem, but that support is declining, declining, declining. As we shift from search engines to answer engines, the future is going to look different than the past, and I think that there are three possible outcomes. The most nihilistic of all is you starve to death and die. I personally, and other journalists, don’t want that. And not just journalists. Academics, researchers, that whole group. It is terrifying to me how many people out there, sort of the AI maximalist camp, are like, “Why do we need journalists anymore? We have drones.” And I'm like, “You really have no earthly idea what good journalism is.” Sure, the facts, you can do that. But the real color of someone saying, “Hey, your house just was swept away in the flood. How are you dealing with that?” That really is an incredibly important thing. The reporting, the storytelling, the investigative work. It is human-led work. So the nihilistic version is awful and I think unlikely to happen. The second possibility, which I think is frighteningly likely to happen, is what I would call theBlack Mirrorpossibility, which is that journalists and academics and researchers don't go away, but we don't go back to the media of the 1980s. We go back to the media of the 1400s, where every journalist, every researcher, every academic is employed by one of five big families. But it's not families anymore. It's AI companies. And it's not too crazy to imagine a world where Sam Altman says, “You know what? We're just gonna stand up our own Associated Press.” Right? “Lots of unemployed journalists out there. We're gonna hire them; we're gonna stand up bureaus all around the world.” If they do that, then Anthropic has to do it, and everyone else has to do it. Then they’re feeding the machine that’s out there. If that happens, we get back to my college thesis, which [means] there will be a conservative one, and there will be a liberal one, and there’ll be a Chinese one, and there’ll be an Indian one. Europeans will try to create one and eventually just use the liberal US one. That’s not crazy, but think about how backwards-moving that is. The internet has been this great information equalizer, democratizer. And in this world, all of a sudden, you subscribe to one of the five big AI companies and you get their perspective. It’s going to be very difficult if it’s thousands of dollars a month for your AI subscription. You’re not going to subscribe to two, very few people will. So information in that world gets incredibly siloed, but it’s not crazy. OK. What’s the third possibility? Right now everyone’s getting content for free. In the future, I think the AI companies will look less like science labs and look more like Netflix, where what differentiates them is whether or not they have access to unique content, and that unique content is something they will be willing to pay for. That’s the day in which not only Google but OpenAI and Perplexity and Anthropic and all the different AI companies—hopefully there are thousands of them—are sending you a check. Well, I’m waiting. But Cloudflare is doing something very fundamental in helping ensure that third possibility becomes a reality. Tell us a little bit about how that works. OK, so that third possibility is a market. The one thing that every market has in common is scarcity. You can't have a market if there's no scarcity. Like there’s no market for breathable air because in most places there’s plenty of breathable air. Yeah, for now. We’ve talked about a lot of dystopian futures, and we can talk about more if you want, but let’s just try to figure out … … let’s stick to this one. So the problem that we saw was that our customers who were publishers, and the entire publishing industry, wasn’t creating scarcity. A lot of that was that they didn't have the technical wherewithal to actually identify who the AI scrapers were and block them from taking their content. We're really good at that. Like that's what we do every day. We built these tools to stop Chinese hackers or Iranian hackers or Russian hackers. But those same tools also identify “that’s the Perplexity bot” or “that’s the ByteDance bot.” We can give publishers the tools to do that. If our mission is to help build a better internet, it makes total sense for us to not only build those tools, but then make them available for free to anyone who is creating content online and wants to say, “I don't want you to have my content unless there's some exchange of value.” There’s always been an exchange of value in the search engine world. The exchange of value was that the search engine got your content and in exchange they sent you traffic and then helped you monetize that traffic. As the world moves toward answer engines, we have to figure out what that new exchange of value is, but step one is creating scarcity. Have companies taken you up on that offer? What’s the response been like? On the content creator, publisher side it has been extraordinary. Everyone from the Associated Press to Ziff Davis and every publisher in between has come to us and said, “We've been waiting for someone to come along.” The most common thing I’ve heard as I’ve talked to the CEOs of publishing houses is, “I’ve gone from being just depressed, like there’s nothing I can do, to actually being optimistic.” I mean, I cannot overstate what a significant step this is. The music industry on some level is an analogy. The day before Steve Jobs steps on stage and announces iTunes, 99 cents per song, the entire music industry is worth $8 billion. Not revenue, market cap. That’s a big number, but for the influence that it had in that world, it was actually relatively modest. Ninety-nine cents a song isn’t the business model that ended up winning. It ended up being something closer to Spotify, and there’s still record sales. There’s Spotify and Apple Music and Tidal and YouTube and TikTok. They’re all sending dollars to music creators. Spotifysent $10 billion. So they sent more in cash to music creators and that ecosystem in the last year than the entire industry was worth 18 years ago. You've gotten a lot of really positive press for this. What's in it for Cloudflare beyond that? I was my college newspaper editor. My wife and I bought our local hometown newspaper, but not because we're making any money off of it. Because we believe in local journalism. We need journalists, and we need academics, and we need researchers, and we can't have new technology just strangle the business model of that. Personally, that's my motivation from a company perspective. Like this is an existential threat to us. If the internet stops existing, what's left for Cloudflare to do? So one of the things that is really important to us is a thriving and vibrant internet ecosystem. Even if it didn't contribute a single dollar in revenue to us. But it's contributing revenue to us already because we're seeing folks like your parent company and others who are saying, “This is important, and we were using someone else and now we're shifting to Cloudflare.” I want to ask you a little bit about a different aspect of what you guys do. So you have this massive network, right? One hundred and twenty-five countries. You released an outage summary on internet blockages or interruptions around the world and found that there were no government-directed outages in the first three months of this year, but the second three months were a different story. Can you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing? It's interesting how there's a seasonality to this and that seasonality happens for what is a pretty silly reason in my estimation. There are a lot of countries in the world that believe access to the internet gives students an unfair advantage if they're taking standardized tests. Oh, really? So at the end of the school year, you'll see a massive uptick in the internet being turned off in those countries to deny access to students to be able to cheat on the tests. What's depressing about that? First, they've designed tests that you can cheat on so easily just by having access to the internet. Second, we see it being turned off in those countries in poor regions but left on in rich regions. Which is a way that powerful people are helping their own kids but punishing the poorer kids. But what worries me the most is that it's normalizing the idea that it's OK for the government, for what is a relatively silly reason, to turn off the internet and that they have essentially built the tooling to be able to do that on the back of “we must protect the children.” That same tooling—whenever there’s an election and they want to suppress any kind of other party that might kick them out of power, whenever there’s any sort of civil unrest or protests, they can use that same tooling. That is fascinating. I have to ask, in the context of the US administration right now, have you seen any changes in the online environment since Trump took office? No is the answer. We had a great relationship with the Obama administration. We had a great relationship with the first Trump administration. We had a great relationship with the Biden administration. We have, so far, had a great relationship with the second Trump administration. It's in the US’s interest for there to be more global internet access. If there is a change, the one place where I think that there has been what we view as a positive change has been that some of the internet blocking or restrictions or what we saw out of the UK where they were trying to force back doors into encryption, some aspects of the Trump administration, the current State Department, have said that's actually a trade issue. So I actually think that the current Trump administration has been more aggressive at protecting the internet than we saw from the Biden administration. When you think about everything that your company is across, what is it that's waking you up at 3 in the morning right now? What do you worry about? The business model of the internet is breaking, and if content creators don't have an incentive to create content, if they can't get famous and they can't get rich, they're just going to stop creating content. That's an existential threat. That's the nightmare, the dream that wakes me up. What makes you excited? What are you optimistic about? So we, for the first time in human history, have a relatively good mathematical model. To describe the totality of human knowledge, it's not perfect. But if you take all the AI companies that are out there, they have these giant decision trees that they've created. It’s the best representation of human knowledge that we've ever had, and it tells us what we know, but it also tells us what we don't know. I analogize it to being like a giant block of Swiss cheese. There's a lot of cheese, but there's a bunch of holes in that cheese. The thing that actually makes me super optimistic is that if we do this right, creating a set of incentives that reward content creators for filling in the holes, that is a lot better business model and a much healthier business model than the old traffic generation. My evidence that we're onto something is we've seen a handful of content deals, and the company that has gotten the best deal by far is Reddit. We know from their public filings that last year they got close to $140 million a year from Google and OpenAI. Hmm. If you compare that with a similar deal that was done for The New York Times, they got about $20 million. So Reddit got seven times more than The New York Times. Why? Well, maybe it's crazy … I think I know where you're going, and I'm gonna agree with you, but [$140 million compared to $20 million is] a wildly different number. Yeah. But 20 minutes ago we both, I think, agreed that we're nostalgic for the quirky internet ... Oh, I love Reddit. … and there's nothing that represents that more than Reddit. The New York Times is amazing, but if you have data from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, like how much real difference is there? Basically the facts stay the same between those, whereas Reddit is this unique content, and so we already have some evidence that the business model of the AI-driven web is going to be one that rewards the Reddits of the world more. All right. I gotta figure out what hole in the Swiss cheese I'm gonna fill. You know, the scariest meeting I’ve had in the last little bit was coffee with Anna Wintour. My wife was like, “You have to wear a suit.” And I’m like, “I don’t have anything.” Wait. This is really important. What did you wear, Matthew? It was in New York and it was a hundred degrees outside, a hundred percent humidity. The only suit I had was this light blue, fall, relatively heavy suit. So, I wore the suit. Oh boy. Anna probably rolled her eyes at this. But I also was just a sweaty mess. So I think it was a pretty embarrassing meeting. This is a shocking visual. I'm sure she thought it went great. The thing about my boss is that she's actually really, really nice. So there you go. She was incredibly, incredibly lovely, and so thoughtful about the whole content and media industry. So I really appreciated the opportunity to get to pick her brain. That's really funny. Even though my sartorial sense is pretty … Trust me, so is mine. I know the feeling. Before we end, I wanna play a little game we came up with. It's called Control, Alt, Delete. What piece of tech would you love to control? What piece would you alt, so alter or change, and what would you delete? What would you vanquish from the Earth if given the opportunity? So, delete. I'd probably say TikTok. Zero protein, very low-value content, I think, is really dangerous and damaging. Um, control. I feel super privileged in terms of what we do at Cloudflare, so I would love to have significant influence in thinking through what the next business model of the web looks like. I don't necessarily wanna control it, but I would love to at least control making sure that we're rewarding filling the holes in the cheese. Then, alt. I'm still longing for a home automation system that doesn't suck. Because I showed up at my house in Austin and the light switches didn't work and I couldn't turn the TV on. You know, a smart home that was a little bit smarter.

       " {'title': \"Facing Trump's pressure, the Fed cuts rates for the first time this year\",\n",
       "  'text': 'Scott Horsley Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues lowered their benchmark interest rate Wednesday, amid fears of a weakening job market.Kent Nishimura/Getty Imageshide caption The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point Wednesday in an effort to prop up the sagging U.S. job market. The move comes as Fed policymakers face mounting pressure from the White House. As widely expected, the central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate to a range of 4% to 4.25%. That was the first such cut in nine months amid signs of a substantial slowdown in the pace of hiring. Fed policymakers also signaled that on average they expect to cut rates by an additional half-percentage point by the end of this year. Loading... President Trump wants much lower interest rates, and he has been waging a high-pressure campaign to exert more control over the central bank — bypassing safeguards designed to insulate the Fed from political pressure. Trump installed a White House economist, Stephen Miran, as a new member of the Fed\\'s governing board. The Senate voted mostly along party lines toconfirm Miran\\'s appointmenton Monday, less than 24 hours before this week\\'s Fed meeting began. Miran broke with his Fed colleagues on Wednesday and voted for a larger, half-point rate cut. Trump also sought to prevent another member of the Fed\\'s governing board from participating in the meeting. The presidenttried to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cookin a social media post last month. Cook\\'s dismissal has beentemporarily blockedby federal courts. The White House says it will ask the Supreme Court to allow the firing to go forward. If Trump ultimately succeeds in replacing Cook, his appointees would hold a majority on the Fed\\'s seven-member governing board. Longtime Fed watchers say that this could seriously compromise the central bank\\'s ability to make tough decisions on interest rates free from the short-term political demands of the White House. The Fed has been cautious about cutting interest rates this year, out of concern that Trump\\'s tariffs could rekindle inflation. Double-digit import taxes have raised prices on goods such as coffee, clothing and small appliances. Theoverall cost of living in Augustwas up 2.9% from a year ago. That was the largest annual increase in seven months. Concerns about stubborn inflation have taken a back seat for now, though, to worries about aweakening job market. U.S. employers added just 22,000 jobs in August, and revised figures show the economy actually lost jobs in June for the first time since 2020. The unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, at 4.3%. But that\\'s partly because the administration\\'s crackdown on immigration is limiting the number of available workers. \"While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,\" Fed Chair JeromePowell told a gathering of central bankerslast month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \"This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\" On average, members of the Fed\\'s rate-setting committee project the unemployment rate will climb to 4.5% by the end of this year—the same rate they were forecasting in June.'},\n",

       " {'title': \"Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business?\",\n",
       "  'text': 'One of the key audiences that the prime minister and the chancellor will have to convince at this year\\'s Labour conference are the business leaders they targeted with a charm offensive before the election last July. The party trumpeted itself as \"the natural party of business\" and Rachel Reeves told anyone and everyone that this would be \"the most pro-business government this country has ever seen\". Labour had some big business beasts backing them. Billionaire mobile phone tycoon John Caudwell - a long-time Conservative supporter -switched his backing to Labour. Some 120 business leaders signed a letter which read: \"We, as leaders and investors in British business, believe that it is time for a change. For too long now, our economy has been beset by instability, stagnation, and a lack of long-term focus. \"Labour has shown it has changed and wants to work with business to achieve the UK\\'s full economic potential.\" But post-election, the party sent a different message - warning of tough choices and hard times ahead, and delivered a Budget to prove it. That Budget, says John Caudwell, with its £25bn rise in employers\\' National Insurance, undid a lot of the goodwill the chancellor had garnered. \"I think there was a desperate loss of faith from the business community in general from the last Budget,\" he says. \"I think people were shocked at the level of negative components for businesses.\" On top of that NI rise, theNational Living Wagewas hiked by an inflation-busting 6.7%, with a rise of 16% for 18 to 20-year-olds. Mr Caudwell says he understands that Labour needed to raise money to shore up the public finances but felt it hit some sectors unduly hard. \"Even if you say they needed to be done, certain aspects were very unfair. So if you look at the increase in employers\\' NI, that really badly hit those businesses that employ tens of thousands of people on low wages, because they got hit by minimum wage and they got hit by the NI.\" Other small business owners have also told the BBC they have lost confidence. Rachel Carrell is the boss of childcare firm Koru Kids and signed that letter in 2024. She says she hopes the government can restore business confidence over the rest of the parliament. \"I wouldn\\'t sign that letter today but they\\'ve got three or four years to turn this around. That\\'s a really long time.\" She believes there\\'s an opportunity to fix things in the upcoming Budget, but says \"they need to move quickly\". While anecdotal evidence of crumbling business confidence is not hard to find, official measures show a mixed picture. The Institute of Directors\\' confidence measure shows a steep fall after the last election, which compilers put down to immediate warnings issued by the government once in power that tough times and tough choices lay ahead. That was duly delivered on by the Budget and has hovered near those lows ever since. However, the government\\'s favourite index to quote is the Lloyds Bank confidence survey, which shows confidence on the future is much more robust. Other measures, including the ICAEW and the S&P PMI measures, tend to support a more gloomy outlook. That in turn is supported by the number of businesses looking to recruit. Job vacancies have been on a downward trend since the Covid pandemic and there are 150,000 fewer staff on payrolls now than there were before the Budget bombshell, with a large part of those jobs going in hospitality. However, there is widespread hope among smaller businesses that the long-promised overhaul of business rates will come soon and in their favour. The government points understandably to theenormous amounts of money pledged recentlywhen tech royalty from Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and others met real royalty at US President Donald Trump\\'s recent state visit. John Caudwell welcomed it too. \"I hear a lot of negativity about government - we hear about rich people leaving and they are useful to the UK economy, but they\\'re not as useful as the£150bn of inward investmentthat we\\'ve got coming into the country to create high-paid jobs in high-technological businesses. So we have to get a balanced view on that.\" Mark Brearley runs a trolley and tray manufacturing and export business in Peckham, south London. He is less impressed with the razzamatazz surrounding the tech billionaires and their largesse. \"I\\'m sure it\\'s very important to get these racy high-growth sectors to invest here. But what about the less exciting bits of the economy - the ones who are always here? We feel forgotten. \"I was hopeful that a new government would give us some help but all my costs have gone up - my business rates have doubled. I\\'m more cautious about investing in a new machine, a new product, hiring a new person.\" The newEmployment Rights Bill, which confers greater rights and protections on employees from day one, is also adding to employers\\' reluctance to take on new staff. The government has made much of its plans to sweep away impediments to economic growth and has seen that acknowledged by some of the biggest investors in UK infrastructure. Just months after Labour entered Downing Street, Scottish Power announced a £24bn UK investment. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, says: \"The government has taken on the planning bogeyman to unlock growth and get us building. That\\'s why the UK is now Iberdrola\\'s biggest investment destination globally.\" Rain Newton-Smith, director general of the employers group the CBI, also gives the government high marks on the international stage. \"I think this government have navigated really difficult geopolitics. We\\'ve got a better deal with the US than others, we\\'re forging a closer relationship with Europe and they got the deal with India. \"They\\'ve got a lot of work done internationally, and that does count. But they\\'ve really got to dial up delivery, and make sure that they they learn from the mistakes of last autumn.\" Business confidence is a vital but fragile thing. It\\'s a key ingredient for any government hoping that economic growth will pay for its other spending commitments - on heath, defence and welfare. Labour has a job on its hands at conference, and at the Budget, to restore the animal spirits of UK business.

       "  'text': 'Rachel Reeves has pushed for an \"ambitious\" youth migration deal with the EU in a bid to improve the outlook of the public finances ahead of the autumn Budget. The chancellor toldthe Timesan exchange scheme for young workers would be \"good for the economy, good for growth and good for business\". The UK agreed to work towards a \"youth experience visa\" with the EU in May this year but the specifics of the scheme are still being negotiated. Reeves also called for the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential economic impact of such a scheme into its forecasts ahead of the Budget, which she hopes will reduce the need for spending cuts or tax rises. The proposal has previously been criticised by the Conservatives and Reform UK, who have said it amounts to a partial return to freedom of movement, which ended when the UK left the EU. Such a scheme could mean those aged 18-30 could stay for two or three years, but the details are to be negotiated. In an interview with the Times ahead of the Labour Party\\'s conference in Liverpool this week, the chancellor declined to specify how many visas could be issued annually under the scheme. The UK already has similar schemes with 11 countries including Australia, New Zealand and Japan, with people able to stay for up to three years depending on where they apply from. Under those agreements, the UK issued just over 24,000 youth mobility visas in 2024. The OBR has previously scored UK growth down by 4% due to the original Brexit deal. The chancellor believes that has set a precedent and that the OBR should include the projected economic upsides of a youth mobility scheme into its upcoming forecast. Referencing the agreement between London and Brussels earlier this year, Reeves told the Times: \"As a result of that reset in May, we think the economy will be stronger. We also want the OBR to score that.\" Liberal Democrat Europe spokesperson James MacCleary said the government is \"moving far too slowly,\" and needs \"firm action now\" to bring revenue to the exchequer. The OBR will send its first economic forecast to the treasury on Friday, which will include the gap the chancellor will need to make up in her 26 November Budget. Much is depending on the OBR\\'s expected downgrade to the underlying long-term performance of the economy, or productivity. The gap could be £20 or £30bn per year. In response, the chancellor has stressed a series of measures aimed to help the economy grow faster, including further trade deals. If accepted by the independent forecasters, the inclusion of the proposed EU youth mobility scheme into its calculations could theoretically limit the extent of any new tax rises. The OBR has scored policy moves on house building and childcare as helpful to the economy in recent years. Speculation has been rife that the chancellor will be forced to raise taxes or cut spending in order to fill the fiscal hole, despite Labour\\'s election promise not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'In recent weeks, the family has dressed up its business dealings in the veneer of legitimacy. Listen to more stories on theNoaapp. The Trumps have never been known for their subtlety: They like to do things fast, big, and loud. This is especially so in the context of cryptocurrency, a noisy and chaotic industry by nature. Remember our president’s collection of NFTs? Among the depictions on these digital trading cards is a portrait of Donald Trump in an Iron Man–inspired suit, accompanied by the caption “SUPERTRUMP.” Or how about the $TRUMP meme coin and accompanying gamified gala dinner for its biggest investors?  It has been easy, in part because of the bluster of the Trumps’ approach to promotion, todiscount the family’s dalliances in cryptoas a cash grab: The meme coin—which has no function except to facilitate gambling—almost immediately made Trump a crypto billionaire. But recently, the family has taken a decidedly different tack—less Trumpian bombast, and more sober promotion of its crypto businesses. On Wednesday, Eric Trump joined CNBC after American Bitcoin, the crypto-mining company he co-founded, went public and began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange. For the most part, he sounded like any other C-suite exec talking up their company after an IPO: “Watching what the stock is doing right now is just—it’s beautiful and incredibly rewarding.” The public debut of American Bitcoin is just one way that the Trump family’s crypto play has been dressed up over the past two weeks. The crypto firm Trump and his sons co-founded, World Liberty Financial, has aggressivelyexpanded; the media company behind Truth Social hashoovered upmillions in even more crypto; and that same company created anew crypto treasuryto hold the stockpile. This blitz has proven to be enormously consequential (and enormously lucrative) for the maturing Trump crypto empire. Each of these moves has a veneer of legitimacy that the family’s earlier crypto dealings lacked: They are much easier to defend than an Iron Man–inspired NFT, while doing just as much toenrichTrump and his sons.  The core of this maneuver is World Liberty Financial, which, despite counting Trump’s three sons (including 19-year-old Barron) as founders, is by far the most legitimate-seeming operation in Trump’s crypto universe. It is goofy—a “gold paper” issued by the company is plastered with a cartoon of Trump’s face—but the company has attached itself to one of the most bulletproof parts of the crypto industry: stablecoins. These are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of another asset, such as the U.S. dollar, and are typically backed by reserves. Think of them like digital cash. Thanks to a couple years ofwidespreadadoption, stablecoins are now broadly accepted as the crypto industry’s most robust innovation—one of the only true use cases in an industry that has long sought to prove it’s more than just an avenue for speculation.  The company’s stablecoin, USD1, launched back in March—but this week, the company moved to unlock a large tranche of what are known as “governance tokens.” All governance tokens, in theory, can bring a level of accountability and democracy to a crypto project, conferring voting rights that can influence corporate-governance decisions—a little like how shareholders use voting stock to sway public companies. Except that in this case, the governance power conferred by the tokens seems mostly symbolic: World Liberty Financial’s management team likely owns so much of the coin that it can veto the decisions. The Trumps alone hold nearly a quarter of the governance tokens that exist. The family netted as much as $5 billion in “paper wealth” once the tokens hit the market this week, according toThe Wall Street Journal. The tokens, as of today, are likely the Trump family’s most valuable asset, eclipsing all their golf courses and hotels.  It’s a great example of the family’s new crypto philosophy in action. World Liberty Finance certainly presents as a legitimate cryptocurrency business, but it is also, like theTrumpmeme coin, a way to put the Trump brand to work and potentially capitalize on the office of the presidency. In an emailed statement, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Trump’s crypto dealings: “The media’s continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public’s distrust in what they read. Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.”  Just in case the stablecoin operation wasn’t enough to pass the legitimacy test, come Monday, Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, a new crypto company that exists mostly to buy lots of a single coin, will join American Bitcoin as a public company and be listed on Nasdaq. Tellingly, neither of these firms chose to go public through a traditional IPO, which involves all sorts of regulatory hurdles and public disclosures. By fast-tracking these stocks’ public debuts, the Trumps are attempting to prove that these arerealcompanies—legitimate assets backed by the fundamentals, rather than vaporware. Nasdaq, unlike some of the exchanges that listed the Trump meme coin, can be halted and controlled.  Few serious crypto investors could support Trump’s meme coin with a straight face (Anthony Scaramuccifamously called it“Idi Amin level corruption”), but today those same investors can point to American Bitcoin, or to World Liberty Financial’s stablecoins, or to Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, and say,See?You can still buy the meme coin, or the Trump NFTs, or any of those other, more questionable, assets—but in the realer parts of their crypto empire, the Trumps have a perfect cover.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Scott Horsley Lisa Cook testifies during her Senate Banking nomination hearing in Washington, D.C., on June 21, 2023.Drew Angerer/Getty Imageshide caption A federal judge in Washington D.C., temporarily blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook late Tuesday night. The ruling stymies Trump\\'s aggressive effort to exercise more control over the central bank, at least for now. The Justice Department filed notice on Wednesday saying Trump plans to appeal. Federal District Judge Jia Cobb granted Cook apreliminary injunction,finding that the president\\'s effort to remove Cook likely violated the Federal Reserve Act. Under that law, designed to insulate the central bank from political interference, Fed governors can only be removed \"for cause.\" Judge Cobb found that in order to warrant firing, the cause would likely be limited to bad conduct while in office. Trump had sought to fire Cook on the basis of unproven allegations that she had made false statements on a mortgage application in 2021, before joining the Fed\\'s board. Judge Cobb also ruled that Trump had likely violated Cook\\'s right to due process and that firing Cook would result in \"irreparable harm\" to the Fed governor. \"This ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference,\" Cook\\'s attorney Abbe Lowell wrote in a statement. \"Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law.\" Trump sought to fire Cook in a social media post last month. It was his latest attack on the Fed as he tries to pressure the central bank to lower interest rates more quickly. Cook, however, has continued serving at the Fed as the court case proceeds. Trump\\'s attacks against the Fed — and his attempted firing of Cook — have raised concerns about the central bank\\'s independence. The Fed has long operated with autonomy to set interest rates, free from political pressure, given how vital its decisions are in helping shape the U.S. and global economies. But Trump is now looking to reshape the Fed\\'s seven-member governing board. Trump already has an opportunity to appoint one new member to the Fed\\'s governing board after thesurprise resignation of Adriana Kuglerin August. Trump has nominated Stephen Miran, a White House economic adviser, to temporarily fill Kugler\\'s role. Miran appeared for hisSenate confirmation hearinglast week and is now waiting for a vote by the full Senate. The Senate committee that oversees the Federal Reserve gave Miran a green light Wednesday on a party-line vote. By removing Cook, Trump hoped to create a second vacancy that he could fill. If he ultimately succeeds in replacing Cook, Trump appointees would occupy a majority of seats on the Fed board. Two Fed governors, appointed by Trump during his first term in the White House, dissented from their colleagues and voted for a rate cut during the last Fed meeting in July. The central bank\\'s next rate setting meeting is this coming week. The Fed is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point in response to a weakening job market.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Scott Horsley A key report on the job market will not be published this week as a result of the government shutdown.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide caption A key report on the job market will not be published on Friday, as scheduled, as a result of the government shutdown. That means businesses and policymakers will be left guessing about the strength of the labor market at a time when the U.S. economy appears to be slowing. If the shutdown drags on for more than a few days, a report on inflation scheduled for mid-October could also be delayed. That report is part of the formula used to calculate the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) that Social Security recipients receive next year. The number-crunching bureau at the Labor Department is one of many government agencies idled by the shutdown. A similar work stoppage in 2013 delayed key economic reports for more than two weeks. The shutdown comes at a sensitive time for the economy.Hiring slowed sharply in recent months, and government tallies showed that employers actually cut jobs in June for the first time since 2020. The unemployment rate inched up to 4.3% in August — its highest reading in almost four years. The September jobs report would ordinarily help shed light on whether those trends continued into early fall. Concerns about weakness in the job market prompted the Federal Reserve tocut interest ratesin September for the first time all year. The Fed faces another rate-setting decision in four weeks, and policymakers would like to have up-to-date information on hiring and unemployment. Inflation has also heated upslightly in recent months, partly as a result of President Trump's tariffs. Consumer prices in August were up 2.9% from a year ago, compared with a 2.7% annual increase the previous month. Inflation figures for September are supposed to be released on Oct. 15. The cost-of-living readings for July, August and September are used to calculate the annual Social Security COLA. While there are alternative measures of economic activity, none can match the reach of the federal government, which surveys tens of thousands of households and businesses every month. Even before the shutdown, staffing cuts at the Bureau of Labor Statistics had forced the government toscale back its monthly price checks. The agency says that during the shutdown, it will not collect, process or share economic data. Once funding is restored, the BLS says, it will resume normal operations and publish an updated schedule of when data will be released.\"},\n",

       " {'title': 'Trump to place import taxes on drugs, home furnishings and heavy trucks',\n",
       "  'text': 'By The Associated Press Containers are piled upon a cargo terminal in Frankfurt, Germany, on Sept. 9, 2025.Michael Probst/APhide caption WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will put import taxes of 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture and 25% on heavy trucks starting on Oct. 1. The posts on his social media site showed that Trump\\'s devotion to tariffs did not end with the trade frameworks and import taxes that werelaunched in August, a reflection of the president\\'s confidence that taxes will help to reduce the government\\'s budget deficit while increasing domestic manufacturing. While Trump did not provide a legal justification for the tariffs, he appeared to stretch the bounds of his role as commander-in-chief by stating on Truth Social that the taxes on imported kitchen cabinets and sofas were needed \"for National Security and other reasons.\" Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the administration launched a Section 232 investigation in April about the impacts on national security from pharmaceutical drug and truck imports. TheCommerce Departmentlaunched a 232 investigation into timber and lumber in March, though it\\'s unclear whether the furniture tariffs stem from that. The tariffs are another dose of uncertainty for the U.S. economy with a solid stock market but a weakening outlook for jobs and elevated inflation. These new taxes on imports could pass through to consumers in the form of higher prices and dampen hiring, a process that economic data suggests is already underway. \"We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned in arecent news conference, adding that higher costs for goods account for \"most\" or potentially \"all\" of the increase in inflation levels this year. The president has pressured Powell to resign, arguing that the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rates more aggressively because inflation is no longer a concern. Fed officials have stayed cautious on rate cuts because of the uncertainty created by tariffs. Trump said on Truth Social that the pharmaceutical tariffs would not apply to companies that are building manufacturing plants in the United States, which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\" It was unclear how the tariffs would apply to companies that already have factories in the U.S. In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shock waves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase. The pharmaceutical drug announcement was shocking as Trump has previously suggested that tariffs would be phased in over time so that companies had time to build factories and relocate production. On CNBC in August, Trump said he would start by charging a \"small tariff\" on pharmaceuticals and raise the rate over a year or more to 150% and even 250%. According to the White House, the threat of tariffs earlier this year contributed to many major pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly, among others, to announce investments in U.S. production. Pascal Chan, vice president for strategic policy and supply chains at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, warned that the tariffs could harm Americans\\' health with \"immediate price hikes, strained insurance systems, hospital shortages, and the real risk of patients rationing or foregoing essential medicines.\" The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates. The National Association of Realtors on Thursday said there were signs of price pressures easing as sales listings increased 11.7% in August from a year ago, but the median price for an existing home was $422,600. Trump said that foreign-made heavy trucks and parts are hurting domestic producers that need to be defended. \"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted. Trump has long maintained that tariffs are the key to forcing companies to invest more in domestic factories. He has dismissed fears that importers would simply pass along much of the cost of the taxes to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices. His broader country-by-country tariffs relied on declaring an economic emergency based on a 1977 law, a drastic tax hike that two federal courts said exceeded Trump\\'s authority as president. The Supreme Court is set to hear the case in November. The president continues to claim that inflation is no longer a challenge for the U.S. economy, despite evidence to the contrary. The consumer price index has increased 2.9% over the past 12 months, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes. Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000. \"There\\'s no inflation,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We\\'re having unbelievable success.\" Still, Trump also acknowledged that his tariffs against China had hurt American farmers, who lost out on sales of soybeans. The president separately promised on Thursday to divert tariff revenues to the farmers hurt by the conflict, just as he did during his first term in 2018 and 2019 when his tariffs led to retaliation against the agricultural sector.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'After weeks of anticipation on Wall Street and elsewhere, policymakers at the Federal Reserve, which is one of the few remaining independent agencies that hasn’t yet fallen under the control ofDonald Trump, will meet in the coming days to set a key interest rate. Trump has recently renewedhis attacks on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Fed, following asharp slowdownin job growth throughout the summer. He has also demanded a bigger rate cut than Powell and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (F.O.M.C.), which holds eight scheduled meetings each year to determine monetary policy, are likely to deliver, though that is the least of his efforts to exert control over the central bank. Last week, Senate Republicans moved to confirm Stephen Miran, the chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a short-term vacancy on the Fed’s Board of Governors. For now, Trump has backed off from his threats to fire Powell, whom he nominated in 2017 before turning against him shortly thereafter. But he is pressing ahead with his effort to oust another Fed governor, Lisa Cook, whom one of his minions, Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has accused of mortgage fraud. Last week, a federal judge said Trump hadn’t “stated a legally permissible cause for Cook’s removal,” and allowed her to remain in her role. The Administration promptly appealed the ruling, asking a circuit court to allow it to forge ahead with Cook’s dismissal before the meeting, which starts on Tuesday. Policy disputes between Presidents and the Fed aren’t new, though we are witnessing something unprecedented. Until now, the most contentious showdown between the White House and the Fed came in January, 1951, when President Harry Truman summoned the members of the F.O.M.C. to the White House for a dressing-down. Then, as now, the source of the dispute was the President’s demand for low borrowing costs, but the context was very different. In April, 1942, shortly after the United States entered the Second World War, the Fed agreed to peg short-term rates at three-eighths of one per cent and long-term rates at 2.5 per cent. To enable the U.S. government to finance a huge expansion in defense spending, the Fed created large sums of money and used it to purchase Treasury bonds, an action that buoyed bond prices and kept their yields low. Large-scale monetary expansions are often associated with inflation, but wartime price controls helped keep price rises in check. In the postwar years, however, inflation picked up, and the United States’ entry into the Korean War, in June, 1950, heightened inflationary pressures. By the start of the following year, prices were increasing at an annual rate of about twenty per cent. These developments alarmed Fed officials, many of whom wanted to raise interest rates to bring down inflation. In testimony on Capitol Hill, the Fed chairman at the time, Marriner S. Eccles, who had been appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, described the interest-rate cap as “an engine of inflation.” But Truman, who had one eye on preserving the value of war bonds that many Americans had purchased, was determined to keep it in place. He convened the F.O.M.C. members, and argued that raising rates could jeopardize the financing of the Korean War and the global fight against Communism. The next day, the White House and the Treasury Department announced that the Fed had agreed to maintain its existing policy for the duration of the security emergency. But the members of the F.O.M.C. had agreed to no such thing. When reporters from the New YorkTimesand the WashingtonPostcalled Eccles, he told them this, and the outlets reported his comments without attribution. The dispute was now out in the open, and the Truman White House was shown to have misled the public. Eccles also released to the press an internal Fed memorandum that recorded the details of the meeting. As Eccles put it later on, “the fat was in the fire.” For a month, the dispute escalated. Tense meetings were held. Various senators got involved. The Fed informed the Treasury that it was “no longer willing to maintain the existing situation in the Government security market.” Eventually, the White House and the Treasury backed down. The then Treasury Secretary, John W. Snyder, had been sidelined by an illness, so one of his top lieutenants, William McChesney Martin, negotiated a compromise with the Fed; the deal was finalized in early March. Under this agreement, which came to be known as the Treasury-Fed Accord, the central bank agreed to keep a key interest rate fixed until the end of the year, but it no longer committed to a permanent cap. Effectively, it was free to concentrate on fighting inflation. Soon after, Truman appointed Martin as Fed chair, intending to have his own man in place. But, rather than catering to Truman’s desire for a cheap-money policy, Martin acquired a reputation as an inflation hawk. (It was he who likened the Fed’s role to removing the drinks when the party gets raucous.) Years later, according to an informativehistoryof the dispute that was published in 2001 by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, one of twelve regional reserve banks in the U.S., the two men ran into each other on a New York street; Truman looked at Martin, “said one word, ‘traitor,’ and then continued.” After reading this history last week, I called up Jeffrey Lacker, an economist who was president of the Richmond Fed from 2004-17 and who also served as a member of the F.O.M.C. under Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke. (The voting members of the committee consist of seven Fed governors and five regional Fed presidents.) Lacker is a student of the Fed’s history, and a fervent believer in its independence. “Truman had to sue for peace when he was discovered to have lied to the press about the compliance of the F.O.M.C. with his desires,” he told me. “Whether such shaming is an effective mechanism in this climate is not so clear at all.” I interpreted this statement as a diplomatic way of saying that Trump is utterly shameless, and that, in pursuing his goals, he is restrained by neither precedent nor embarrassing facts. (This is someone who was found guilty last year, in a New York civil court, of grossly inflating the value of his real-estate assets to obtain better loan terms, and here he is, accusing Cook of mortgage fraud.) That said, Truman was no pushover. As a Midwestern populist, he viewed the Fed and its allies on Wall Street with deep suspicion. Yet, the Fed was able to prevail over him. Lacker pointed to another reason that this was possible: “The crucial thing in 1951 was the relations that Eccles had behind the scenes with people in the Senate.” Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and later amendments to it, Congress exercises oversight over the Fed, its policies, and appointments to its Board of Governors. Although that relationship can sometimes be antagonistic, the central bank has long had powerful supporters in both parties on Capitol Hill and on its key committees. Since Trump launched his latest assault on the Fed, however, Republican senators have largely remained silent. In an article published last year, Miran, Trump’s Harvard-trained nominee to the Fed board, called for “increased presidential oversight” of the board, and a clarification that “members serve at the will of the U.S. president.” At a recent nomination hearing, Miran vowed to make his own decisions at the Fed. But he has also insisted that, if he is confirmed to the vacant Fed post, which extends to the end of January, 2026, he will merely take a leave of absence from his job at the White House, breaking with the norm of cutting ties to avoid conflicts of interest. When I spoke on the phone with Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking minority member of the Banking Committee, last week, I mentioned that Ben Bernanke left the Bush White House to chair the Fed from 2006-14. “[Bernanke] actually left,” Warren replied, scornfully. “He didn’t keep a foot in the door with an option to return to his old job.” If Miran doesn’t resign from the White House, he would be “entirely dependent” on Trump, Warren added. And yet, despite all these warning signs, Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee nodded through Miran’s nomination with no defections. When the full Senate votes, a similar outcome seems inevitable. “If just four Senate Republicans had the courage to say no,” Warren said, “this craziness with the Fed would stop.” For some old Washington hands, it may be a bit jarring to see the progressive firebrand Warren emerging as a prominent defender of the Fed. In the past, she has criticized the central bank for raising interest rates too sharply, failing to regulate banks adequately, turning a blind eye to dubious stock transactions by its officials, and not being sufficiently transparent or accountable. Miran, too, has called for more accountability. “But what Miran evidently means is accountability to one person—Donald Trump,” Warren told me. “I want a Fed that follows basic ethics rules more vigorously, that has an independent inspector general, and that is more transparent in its dealings. But I don’t want a Fed that elected officials—me or anyone else—can control.” This is obviously what Trump wants, and it’s well within the bounds of possibility. If the Supreme Court buckles to him in the Cook case, as it has in many others, he will be able to nominate someone else to the Fed’s board, and the appointees from his first and second terms will be in the majority. Some Fed veterans are worried that the Trump appointees, at his instigation, could then exploit their position to fire all the regional-reserve-bank presidents, whose terms of office come up for renewal in February, 2026. In the past, these renewals, which take place every five years, have been a formality, but in theory they could be used to carry out a purge. Would Republicans on Capitol Hill go along with a mass culling of regional Fed presidents? Based on their recent behavior, it’s not out of the question. Ultimately, the only binding constraint on Trump’s actions could be the reaction of investors, particularly purchasers of Treasury bonds. Lacker said a move against the regional presidents would likely be seen as “so drastic” that “it would trip some wires” in the sixty-trillion-dollarbond market. Back in April, markets tanked after Trump announced his“reciprocal” tariffs, and he backed off, at least in part. The threat of a bond-market meltdown may be just about the only thing deterring a President who presided over the bankruptcy of multiple casino companies from gaining effective control of the entire U.S. economic-policymaking apparatus—fiscal, trade, and monetary. We aren’t there yet, but we are getting perilously close.\\xa0♦'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Los Angeles police have found female human remains in an impounded vehicle that is registered to US singer D4vd. Officers responded to a call on Monday of \"a foul odour coming from a vehicle\" at a tow yard, where detectives found the remains in the car, LAPD officials told the BBC. CBS News, the BBC\\'s US partner, reported that the Tesla is registered to D4vd, whose real name is David Anthony Burke. Detectives said they had not identified a person of interest. D4vd\\'s spokesman told NBC the singer had been \"informed about what\\'s happened, and although he is still out on tour, he is fully co-operating with the authorities\". The singer performed on Tuesday in Minneapolis. The LAPD did not confirm details about the car or its owner to BBC News. Officer Charles Miller said an investigation is under way and that detectives believe the impounded car was likely to have been there for \"a couple of days\". The Tesla, which has a Texas licence plate, was towed from the Hollywood Hills after it was abandoned five days earlier. Local news station KTLA obtained aerial footage of the tow yard, showing a black Tesla with officers huddling around its front trunk. According to the Los Angeles Times, a head and torso were found in a bag inside the trunk.

       "  'text': 'By Maria Aspan President Donald Trump listens to a reporter\\'s question in the Oval Office of the White House, on Friday.Alex Brandon/APhide caption President Trump\\'slatest executive actionon immigration will sharply curtail a visa program used by hundreds of thousands of people currently living in the United States. It also threatens some operations of the big tech companies that havetried hard to curry favorwith Trump this year, raising the question of how much return those companies are getting on that ongoing investment. The president on Friday signeda proclamationadding a $100,000 fee for high-skilled workers to enter the country through the H-1B visa program. It\\'s a steep and dramatic overhaul for a program that many large companies have used to hirethousands of software engineersand other highly specialized workers. Now, some of those companies are warning their workers to remain in the United States — or to scramble to return by midnight tonight. \"We realize this is short notice but returning soon is advisable and you should make every effort possible to clear U.S. customs before 12:00 a.m. EDT (9:00 p.m. PDT) on Sunday, September 21, 2025,\" Amazon wrote to employees this weekend, according to an internal memo published byBusiness Insiderand also reported byReuters. (Spokespeople for Amazon did not respond to NPR\\'s requests for comment on Saturday.) Microsoft and JPMorgan Chase sent similar messages to employees after Trump signed the executive order. (Microsoft did not respond to NPR requests for comment; a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson declined to comment.) The new $100,000 fee only applies to new visas, not renewals or current visa holders, a White House official told NPR on Saturday. More than half a million U.S. residents are in the United States on H-1B visas, according to aU.S. government estimate in 2020. Congress allows 85,000 H-1B visas to be issued through a lottery each year, for which the U.S. currently charges a $215 registry fee (though companies then paythousands of dollars morein fees to file a visa application, plus lawyers fees). The H-1B program is intended for highly educated, high-skilled workers like software engineers or medical professionals. American companies seeking to hire a foreigner on an H-1B visa must first attest that they haven\\'t been able to find American workers with similar skills and that the foreigner will earn a salary similar to what an American worker would earn. It\\'s not just tech firms that use this program, although they dominate it.Government datashow that other big sponsors of workers on H-1B visas include JPMorgan Chase, Walmart and staffing firms Tata and Cognizant, which place software engineers and other workers at other big companies. The White House says that these U.S. employers have abused and \"deliberately exploited\" the H-1B visa program to \"replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor,\" Trump\\'s proclamationdeclared. Similar critiques have long been raised by labor economists and politicians across the political spectrum, including SenatorsBernie Sanders(I.-Vt.) andEric Schmitt (R.-Mo.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D.-Calif.).A 2020 studyby the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (EPI) found that most H-1B employers do pay migrant workers less than market rate salaries. \"The program exploits workers,\" saysRon Hira, a Howard University political science professor who studies high-skilled immigration and who has testified before Congress calling for an overhaul of theH-1B visa program. Hira on Saturday cautiously praised Trump\\'s action. \"In a lot of ways, this effort, directionally at least, is in the right direction. It\\'s long overdue,\" he said. But some immigration-focused groups blasted the president\\'s changes to the H-1B program. \"This policy shrinks our talent pipeline, undermines job creation, and hands America\\'s competitive edge to global rivals,\" the American Immigration Council, a nonprofitaffiliatedwith an association of immigration lawyers,wrote on Bluesky. Whatever the ultimate impact on workers, Trump\\'s steep new fee for H-1B visas is a slap in the face of the tech industry, which hires thousands of foreign-born workers every year.This year, Amazon has sponsored the highest number of workers on H-1B visas, followed by Tata, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google. Tesla, the electric carmaker run by onetime Trump ally Elon Musk, also heavily uses the H-1B program (andhas been accused in a lawsuitof using it to underpay workers). Musk and Trumppublicly fell outthis spring. Now Trump\\'s steep new fees on the H-1B visa program highlight the extent to which other tech companies — and the billionaires who run them — are also failing in their ongoing efforts to curry favor with the president. The founders and CEOs of almost all of the top H-1B sponsors have assiduously courted Trump in his second term. They\\'veattended his inauguration,donated moneyto his inaugural fund,tried to stave off his tariffsby promising to invest billions of dollars in the United States and,earlier this month, many went back to the White House to attend a dinner with Trump. Yet the new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas is the latest policy Trump has unveiled that will make itmore difficult— and possibly more expensive — for themto do business. This story has been updated to clarify that the executive action that President Trump took Friday related to H-1B visas was a proclamation and not an executive order.'},\n",
